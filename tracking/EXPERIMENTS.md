# Experiment registry

Every training or comparison run gets its own copied `templates/RUN_RECORD.md`. This table is an index, not a substitute for raw logs.

| Run ID | Question / variant | Train/val/test split hash | Labels / unlabeled | Code/config | Primary metric | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | No training experiments executed | — | — | — | — | NOT STARTED |

## Planned, **not executed**, comparisons

| Design ID | Comparison | Outcome / confounders |
|---|---|---|
| EXP-A | Native-affine ROI versus ANTs rigid ROI | Full septal reference coverage; compute cost |
| EXP-B | Classical intensity + anatomy versus small 3D U-Net | Manual CSP Dice, signed/absolute volume error |
| EXP-C | Matched-budget 3D U-Net versus attention hybrid | Whether attention improves tiny-CSP segmentation |
| EXP-D (optional) | Purely supervised versus pretraining/pseudo-labels | Label efficiency; pseudo-label error amplification |
| EXP-E (optional) | Intensity normalization/augmentation settings | Scanner/scan contrast robustness; avoid fitting on test set |

No unrun comparisons should be described as results in the course report.
